I'll create a todo list to track improvements, then show practical options (low-to-high effort) with pros/cons and code sketches. If you want, I can implement the safest quick-win (batch save + JPA tuning) next and run a build. I'll mark the planning task as completed after this message.

Starting (1/6) Select optimization approach

Updating the todo list to mark the planning step done and keep implementation tasks ready.

Completed (1/6) Select optimization approach

I'll outline concrete options (low-to-high effort) to speed up TransactionsCsvLoader, include pros/cons, and give code sketches and exact changes needed for the safest quick wins. After that I'll implement the recommended quick-win (batch save + small Hibernate tuning) if you confirm.

Summary of what's next

- I'll present 4 practical approaches:
    1. Batch saves with repository.saveAll()/port.saveAll()
    2. Producer-consumer (parallel parsing + batched DB writes)
    3. PostgreSQL COPY (fastest, uses JDBC/Pg API)
    4. DB & Hibernate tuning / index management (complementary)
- For each I'll include required code changes, risks, and expected speedups.
- Recommended immediate implementation: 

    Option 1 (batch saves) + small Hibernate settings. It's low-risk, easy to test, and gives substantial improvement (often 5–10x vs single-row saves).
    
1. Quick win — Batch saves (recommended)
    
    What it does

    - Accumulates parsed TransactionEntity objects into a List and calls a bulk save method every N rows (e.g., 500–2000).
    -  Why it's good
    - Minimal code change.
    - Works with existing Spring Data JPA repository or port.
    - Reduces round-trips and transaction overhead.

    Expected improvement

    - Typical 3x–10x faster vs one-by-one saves depending on DB latency and batch size.

    Code changes needed (high-level)

    - Add a batch size constant and a List<TransactionEntity> buffer.
    - After parsing each row, add to buffer; when buffer.size() >= BATCH_SIZE, flush: call transactionPort.saveAll(buffer) or transactionRepository.saveAll(buffer); then clear buffer.
    - After loop, flush remaining buffer.
    - Ensure saveAll is executed inside a transaction for better performance (annotate a service method with @Transactional).
    - If the port doesn't expose saveAll, add it to TransactionPort and its JPA adapter (simple change).

    Edge cases

    - For very large files, choose a moderate batch (500–2000). Too large uses more memory.
    - If IDs are generated by IDENTITY (autoincrement), Hibernate cannot batch inserts effectively — use sequence/POOLED strategy for even better performance. But saveAll will still be faster.

    Minimal implementation sketch for TransactionsCsvLoader (what I'll change)

    - Add BATCH_SIZE constant (e.g., 1000)
    - Add List<TransactionEntity> buffer = new ArrayList<>(BATCH_SIZE)
    - Replace transactionPort.save(t) with buffer.add(t); if buffer.size()==BATCH_SIZE then transactionService.saveAll(buffer); buffer.clear()
    - At end flush remaining
    - Implement TransactionService.saveAll(List<TransactionEntity>) with @Transactional and delegate to repository.saveAll(list)

    Files to edit

    - TransactionsCsvLoader.java (modify loop)
    - TransactionService.java (add saveAll method)
    - TransactionPort.java (if needed add saveAll signature)
    - TransactionJpaAdapter.java (implement saveAll)

2. Mid effort — Producer-consumer parallel workers
   
   What it does

   - One thread reads lines and puts raw CSV line or parsed DTOs into a BlockingQueue.
   - A fixed-size worker pool (e.g., 4–8 threads) consumes queue items, parses them (if not pre-parsed), batches them and saves to DB concurrently.

    Why it's good

    - Overlaps I/O (file read) and CPU (parsing) with DB I/O. Good when your CPU is underutilized or DB can accept parallel writes.
    
    Expected improvement

   - Additional 1.5x–3x beyond batching depending on CPU/IO balance and DB concurrency.

    Complexity and risks

    - Need to handle backpressure (bounded queue).
    - Must ensure transactional boundaries for each worker (each worker saves its batch in its own transaction).
    - Careful shutdown/poison-pill logic required.
    - Slightly more code and testing.
    
    Files to edit / new classes

    - Update TransactionsCsvLoader to create ExecutorService and BlockingQueue.
    - Add worker class (Runnable) that collects and saves batches.
    - Add graceful shutdown and error handling.
   
3. High-effort, highest-performance — PostgreSQL COPY FROM STDIN

    What it does

    - Use PostgreSQL COPY command to stream CSV directly into the table; bypasses much of ORM overhead.

    Why it's best

    - Very fast: COPY is purpose-built for bulk loads, often 10–100x faster than inserts.

    Complexities

    - Data must be formatted carefully (escape/quote, NULLs) and columns must match.
    - For JPA-managed schema, you must map column order. Better to use a direct table-level load (bypass JPA for the import step) and then optionally reconcile or materialize entities.
    - Dependencies: org.postgresql:postgresql offers CopyManager via PGConnection.
    - If you need triggers or constraints, they still apply; consider disabling indexes for a very large load.

    Files to add/change

    - New service method that opens JDBC connection, unwraps PGConnection, uses CopyManager.copyIn or copyFrom, streams CSV lines.
    - Optionally create a temporary table and use COPY then transform.

4. DB and Hibernate tuning (complementary)

    What to change

    ```
    application.properties:
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.jdbc.batch_size=50 (or 100)
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_inserts=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.order_updates=true
    spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.generate_statistics=false
    ```

    - Entity ID strategy:
        -  If using IDENTITY (auto-increment), switch to SEQUENCE or TABLE or use pooled Optimizer for sequences to enable JDBC batching in Hibernate.
    - Index handling:
        - For very large imports, consider dropping non-essential indexes before load and recreating afterwards.

    Implementation plan (safe path I'll do if you confirm)

   - Implement Option 1: add batching to TransactionsCsvLoader and add a saveAll method in TransactionService with @Transactional which delegates to repository.saveAll.
   - Add small Hibernate tuning properties to application.properties.
   - Run ./mvnw -DskipTests package to ensure compilation passes.
   - Optionally run a small import test and measure times (I can run a "dry" test by processing the first N lines and timing it).

    Would you like me to:

    A) Implement the safe Quick-win (Option 1: batching + small Hibernate settings) now? I'll update the code and run the build.

    B) Implement Option 3 (COPY) instead — I'll outline the exact code but won't change your entities without your confirmation.

    C) Implement producer-consumer (Option 2) — I'll implement it but it will touch more files and require tests.

    Pick A, B, or C (or ask for more details). If A, I'll apply the code changes and run the build.
